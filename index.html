            <p>Hi, I'm Christian Karl B. Leoncio, a 16-year-old computer enthusiast. I'm passionate about anything
                related to computers, and my interest started at a young age. Playing games on websites like friv.com
                and y8.com on our family computer sparked my curiosity about the inner workings of computers and website
                operations.


            </p>

            <p>I'm excited to be taking your CP class, Sir Klyde. Learning C is something I'm really looking forward to
                because I haven't had any experience with that language yet and I think if I learn it, my coding skills
                will
                get a whole lot better. I'm hoping to take on new challenges and gain some cool insights during this
                learning journey. I believe that once I get the hang of C, it will open up more opportunities for me to
                do some really cool stuff with coding.

            </p>

            <p>My ultimate goal is to become a web developer or a backend programmer. I find the idea of getting my
                hands into websites and playing a role in making them function smoothly super appealing. I'm excited
                about the possibility of creating features that people can use and enjoy on websites, and I'm determined
                to work hard and learn as much as I can to make this goal a reality.

            </p>
